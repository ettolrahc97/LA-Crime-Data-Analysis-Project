# LA-Crime-Data-Analysis-Project
In this project, I analyzed crime data from Los Angeles to showcase the skills I’ve learned as a data analyst using Python.
# Project Background
This project utilizes a dataset containing recorded incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles, dating back to 2020. The data is transcribed from original paper-based crime reports, which may introduce minor inaccuracies. To ensure privacy, exact addresses are anonymized and only shown to the nearest hundred block, and some entries with missing location data are recorded as (0°, 0°).

The goal of this project is to thoroughly analyze and synthesize the data to uncover critical insights related to crime patterns, frequency, and locations across Los Angeles. By identifying key trends and anomalies, the analysis aims to support better decision-making for public safety, community awareness, and resource allocation.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
* **Crime Trends Over Time:** An evaluation of crime over time.
* **Victim Demographics:** Analyzing the distribution of victim age.
* **Geographic Crime Patterns:** Analyzing the area name with the highest number of crimes based on the date occurred.
* **Time-Related Patterns:** Getting the average time to report a crime.
