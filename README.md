# LA-Crime-Data-Analysis-Project
In this project, I analyzed crime data from Los Angeles to showcase the skills I’ve learned as a data analyst using Python(Pandas, Matplolib).
# Project Background
This project utilizes a dataset containing recorded incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles, dating back to 2020. The data is transcribed from original paper-based crime reports, which may introduce minor inaccuracies. To ensure privacy, exact addresses are anonymized and only shown to the nearest hundred block, and some entries with missing location data are recorded as (0°, 0°).

The goal of this project is to thoroughly analyze and synthesize the data to uncover critical insights related to crime patterns, frequency, and locations across Los Angeles. By identifying key trends and anomalies, the analysis aims to support better decision-making for public safety, community awareness, and resource allocation.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
* **Crime Trends Over Time:** An evaluation of crime over time.
* **Victim Demographics:** Analyzing the distribution of victim age.
* **Geographic Crime Patterns:** Analyzing the area with the highest number of crimes based on the date occurred.
* **Time-Related Patterns:** Analyzing the average time to report a crime.
  
The Pandas code used to inspect and clean the data for this analysis can be found here[].

The visualizations used to report and explore patterns by time and location can be found here[].

# Data Structure & Initial Checks
LA Crime database structure as seen below consists of one table with a total row count of records. A description of each column is as follows:

# Executive Summary
**Overview of Findings**

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.
